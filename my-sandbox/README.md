### Summary

- see ts_example_github/my-sandbox/
- this is a basic example of using TS with redux
- it came from a combo of two articles:
    - https://medium.com/@pongsatt/how-to-use-redux-in-typescript-ad0b5fe77933
    - https://redux.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript

### TODO

- X - add another slice so that state.config and state.game
- in this way, we should be ready to get back to Game of Life
- add async action with pathological sleep
